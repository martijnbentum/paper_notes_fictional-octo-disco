# An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Self-supervised Discrete Representations of Speech

- Use information-theoretic measures to analyse the distribution o f discrete unite (code vectors) in the Wav2Vec 2.0 model, with respect to phoneme labels.

- phonetically similar sounds exhibit similar distributions

# Models

- Wav2vec 2 base
- Wav2vec-xlsr

# Data

TIMIT

# Method

The codevectors in the two codebooks are used as the set of discrete units. The use the concatenation of the 320 codevectors per codebook -> 640 codevectors in total. (there are I think 320 ^ 2 =102.400 codevectors, because each frame is mapped to a codevector from each codebook)

- Measure the surprisal of a discrete unit under a specific phonetic category. 
- Measure the entropy of a phonetic category i.e. within category acoustic-phonetic variability

- Jensen-Shannon divergence (related to Kullback Leibner divergence, but symmetric, to investigate the whether the distance between distributions of discrete units per phonetic category reflect phonetic similarity

- Use Ward algorithm over the distance matrix generated by category-wise JSD values

# results

The clustering reveals a division between:

- wav2vec base
   - obstruent sounds (plosives, fricatives and affricatives), nasals
   - vowels, approximants
- wav2vec xlsr
   - obstruent
   - sonorant
- surprising: the /h/ is grouped with plosives TL: maybe because of long VOT
- lowest level reflects voiced vs unvoiced

- correlation of JSD with phonetic feature vector (PHOIBLE) reveals a Pearson correlation of ~ r .6 and when only considering vowels ~ r .8 (all correlations are significant)

- discrete units can be characterized as sub-phonemic events

- self reported limitations: speaker variation and context variations are not taken into account
