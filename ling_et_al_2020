# Method
Not really a representational analysis

# Conclusion
" We first propose a novel
objective for a deep bidirectional LSTM network, where large
amounts of unlabeled data are used to learn deep contextualized
acoustic representations (DeCoAR). These DeCoAR features are
used as the representations of labeled data to train a CTC-based
end-to-end ASR model. In our experiments, we show a 42% relative
improvement on WSJ compared to a baseline trained on log-mel
filterbank features. "
